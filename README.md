Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of my app was to provide users with a clean, easy to use way to keep track of an inventory of items. This includes adding and removing items from the inventory tracker, updating quantities, and providing alerts when stocks are low.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A log in screen was the first screen I added followed by the main screen of the app; the inventory management screen. This contained a table for keeping track of various items and both an add and delete button. I aslo added SMS notifications and a small help section instructing users on how to operate the app if there was any confusion.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

At first, I was very overwhelmed by the prospect of coding my app; the whole process seemed well beyond my abilities. But wehn I focused in smaller sections, say setting up the SQL database or adding the various adding/deleting/editing features, it was much more manageable. I will use this strategy in the future to avoid too much anxiety over new projects in the future.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I constantly built and ran my code through the emulator included in Android Studio, making sure that any additions I made didn't negatively affect what I had already done. More often than not it showed there was some error that needed to be fixed, but since I tested so frequently it was a simple matter of returning to the code and editing it.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

This summer has been particulary bad for storms in my area, that coupled with its heavy woods lead to multiple instances of lost power when work needed to be done. Thankfully, with power banks and mobile hotspots, I was able to continue designing even with the weather raging and the power down.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think that my overall design was clean and simple to use. Color choice was pleasing and made all text easily legible, and all of the elements were well thought out and placed logically.
